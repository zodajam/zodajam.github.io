buy the iso file for 10 neocoins in the shop or just download for free at archlinux.org

if your on windows go ahead and download rufus, if your on linux just download balenaEtcher. 

go ahead and flash the iso file to your usb.

when thats done reboot pc and open bios (F2 or F12 most of the time) then select your usb as boot priority number 1

alr now your gonna boot into the live arch linux iso.

cool cool, now type archinstall and follow the thingy ok nice thanks for letting me steal your neocoins
